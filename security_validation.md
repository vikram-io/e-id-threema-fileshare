# E-ID File Signing Security and Compliance Validation

## Overview
This document outlines the security and compliance considerations for the Swiss E-ID integration in our file signing application.

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication Security
- OID4VP protocol implementation follows draft 20 specifications
- JWT tokens include nonce values to prevent replay attacks
- State parameters used to bind sessions and prevent CSRF attacks
- Timeout mechanisms for authentication sessions (5 minutes)

### Cryptographic Security
- ECDSA with P-256 curve for signatures (ES256)
- SHA-256 for file hashing
- Secure key generation and management
- JWT validation for all authentication responses

### Data Security
- File data stored temporarily (24 hours)
- Minimal personal data collection
- Secure storage of authentication sessions
- Cleanup of expired sessions

### API Security
- Input validation on all endpoints
- CSRF protection through state parameters
- Rate limiting considerations
- Error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

## Compliance Considerations

### Swiss E-ID Compliance
- Implementation follows the Swiss Trust Infrastructure specifications
- OID4VP protocol implementation matches the required version
- QR code format compatible with the Swiss E-ID app
- Proper handling of DIDs and verifiable credentials

### Data Protection
- Follows data minimization principles
- Temporary storage of files (24 hours)
- Clear user consent flows
- Secure transmission of data

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Authentication flow with real E-ID app
- [x] QR code scanning with E-ID app
- [x] Callback handling from E-ID app
- [x] Signature verification
- [x] Threema integration for sharing
- [x] File expiration and cleanup
- [x] Error handling and recovery

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Key Management**: Implement proper key management using HSM or secure key storage
2. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring for security events
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated and monitor for security advisories
5. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security testing
6. **Backup and Recovery**: Implement proper backup procedures for critical data
